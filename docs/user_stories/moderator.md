As a **moderator** I want to be able to:
- **ban people by username** so that **the server can stay free from griefing**.
- **unban people by username** so that **people that didn't deserve to be banned can enjoy the server**.
- **whitelist people outside the automatically qualified group** so that **people that should be allowed on the server can enjoy it**.
