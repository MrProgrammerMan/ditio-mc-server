As an **admin** I want to be able to:
- **appoint and remove moderators** so that **the server remains properly managed**.
- **force the server to restart** in order to **enact any changes to the configuration immidiately**.
- **initiate an immidiate backup of the server** in preparation of **server shutdown, maintainance or migration**.
