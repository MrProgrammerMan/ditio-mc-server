As a **player** I want to be able to:
- **register my feide account** so that I can **get access to the minecraft server** if I have the right.
- **register my minecraft username** so that I can **get access to the minecraft server**.
- **change my minecraft username in the system** so that I can **keep access if I switch to another minecraft account**.
- **request access to the server if I don't qualify for automatic access** so that I can **enjoy the minecraft server**.
- **see if I am banned** so that I can **understand why I can't access the server**.
- **see who I can contact to appeal my ban if I am banned** so that I can **reverse the decision if it is a mistake**.
